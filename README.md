# Normal deviates
Generate pseudorandom numbers from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

## Usage

## Example

## Implementation
We use the algorithm of ratio of uniforms with bounds by Leva [1].

## Caveats
* I have no idea about the quality of the normal deviates generated.
* I only tested the generator via visual assessment of the histogram.

## Dependencies

## Test
